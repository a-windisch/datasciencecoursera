## 1. Files contained in this repository

- README.md - This file.
- run_analysis.R - the main R script, see description below.
- CodeBook.md -Contains a description of variables used in the data set

## 2. Short description of the project
Given this [data set](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip) on cell phone
by Davide Anguita, Alessandro Ghio, Luca Oneto, Xavier Parra and Jorge L. Reyes-Ortiz. Human Activity Recognition on Smartphones using a Multiclass Hardware-Friendly Support Vector Machine. International Workshop of Ambient Assisted Living (IWAAL 2012). Vitoria-Gasteiz, Spain. Dec 2012, which contains sensor data of six different movement acitvities (standing, sitting, laying, walking, walking up, walking down), the data has been processed as follows. The test and training sets are merged, and only columns which contain means or stds are kept, together with the corresponding activity. A second data set is produced, which contains the averages of all the measurements with respect to the six different activities. 

## 3. The script file run_analysis.R
This is the main file that reads the data and processes it. The script can be used as follows. Download the data from the link above, and unzip it in a directory. Don't cd into the directory, but set the working directory in the script to the directory that now contains the unpacked directory called UCI HAR Dataset. After setting the working directory, the script can simply be executed. It will print statements describing each step, see Section 'Output of run_analysis.R' below. The script performs the following steps:

- Read in Xtrain.txt, Ytrain.txt, Xtest.txt, Ytest.txt
- Checks whether there are any NAs
- Checks and prints the dimensions of the data frames
- Adds the activities Y to the sets X by introducing a new column
- Reads in column names from file features.txt contained in zip file
- Extracts those columns which contain either a mean or std
- Disregards all other columns from Xtrain and Xtest
- Combines Xtrain and Xtest to Xtotal
- Reads activity names from file activity_labels.txt contained in zip file
- Changes the activity column by replacing the integer values with activity names
- Creates a new data set called Xtotalaverage which contains the averages of all measurements
- Polishes the data set column names by lowercasing where possible, removing underscores, etc.
- Produces concluding remarks with the names and dimensions of the data sets
